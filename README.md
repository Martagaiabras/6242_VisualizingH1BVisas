# 6242_VisualizingH1BVisas

DESCRIPTION

Data on H-1B visa applications is used to develop an interactive and user-friendly visualization tool that provides interstate and intrastate differences between job functions, number of H-1B visas accepted, average salaries per job function, and other variables.

The data is also used to build a model that predicts whether an H-1B visa application is approved or rejected based on annual wage, type of position (full time versus part time), job category, and work-site state. Various classification algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors) are combined, as well as various approaches to handling the large training dataset. This ensemble predictive model has an accuracy of 88.5%.

The visualization tool and predictive model will assist international students in making more informed decisions when seeking employment within the United States.

Data on H-1B visa applications from 2011-2016 can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/nsharan/h-1b-visa. It contains approximately 3 million rows and 52 columns. Data on H-1B visa applications from 2017 can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/jonamjar/h1b-data-set-2017. It contains approximately 600,000 rows and 10 columns. As not all columns are necessary and some rows have missing and/or inconsistent information, this data is first cleaned and filtered with OpenRefine.
