# 6242_VisualizingH1BVisas

Data on H-1B visa applications are used to develop a visualization tool that will provide interstate and intrastatedifferences between job functions, number of H-1B visas ac-cepted, average salaries per job function and other variables.

The visualization tool and the predictive model will assist in-ternational students in making a more informed decision onthe choice of educational institutions and targeted job searchstrategies. 

We expect that this project will help a student tomaximize their chances of getting an H-1B visa approved inthe future.The dataset used in this project contains 6 years of histor-ical data detailing H-1B applications from 2011-2017, withapproximately 3 million records. 

It includes variables describ-ing case status (approved vs reject), work-site coordinates,employer name, job title, wages, occupation code, and yearof H-1B filing. This database will also be used to develop aclassification model for predicting the approval probabilitiesof new H-1B applications. 
Classification algorithms such aslogistic regression, naive bayes, k-nearest neighbors, SVMand random forest will be used to develop a model withhighest accuracy.
